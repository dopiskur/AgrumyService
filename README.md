Agrumy is a backend + admin UI for IoT devices that monitor and control
greenhouse/citrus micro-climate - temperature, humidity, soil moisture, light,
CO2, water level - and drive relays (ventilation, heating, irrigation, lighting)
off configurable thresholds and time intervals. It is the server side of a
system whose device firmware lives in the separate `AgrumyFirmware` repository;
this repository is the API those devices talk to, plus the MVC admin UI
operators use to manage devices and users.

## Mission

Everyone should have the right to grow their own food. In practice, most people
today have neither the knowledge nor the time to keep a food garden alive -
that's the problem Agrumy exists to lower the barrier to, not just a target
market. The same software serves both ends without compromise: a single
hobbyist gets a simple, self-hosted setup for their own greenhouse, while a
larger operation - an agricultural cooperative or commercial nursery managing
several sites - can run the same backend at that scale, without either end
having to adopt tooling built for the other.

Agrumy is free, open-source software that runs on hardware priced like
AliExpress components, not a purpose-built appliance costing thousands.

**.NET 10 SDK required.**

`agrumy.sln` splits into these projects:

| Project | Type | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Agrumy.Shared` | class library | Models (`api.Models`), `Config`, `Security` (`JwtTokenProvider`, `AuthenticationProvider`). Referenced by both apps. |
| `Agrumy.Dal` | class library | Data-access model: `AgrumyDbContext`, EF entities (`api.Dal.Entities`), provider selection (`DbProviderKind`, `DbOptionsFactory`). No stored procedures - every query is LINQ. |
| `Agrumy.Api` | Web API | Device/sensor communication + admin API (`Controllers/API`), one domain-repository interface per facet (`Dal/Interface/I*Repository`, each implemented by its own `Dal/EfXxxRepository` class - `EfDeviceRepository`, `EfUserRepository`, etc., no single god-class), EF Core over `Agrumy.Dal`, MySQL/MariaDB **or** PostgreSQL, JWT bearer auth, Swagger, startup DB health-check + migration/schema bootstrap on an empty or legacy database. |
| `Agrumy.Web` | MVC app | Admin UI (`Controllers/View`, `Views/`, `wwwroot/`). Talks to `Agrumy.Api` **only over HTTP** (`Dal/ApiRepository` + `HttpClient` with a JWT bearer token). No direct database access. |
| `Agrumy.Gateway` | standalone process | Optional LoRa/WiFi-repeater gateway - registers as an ordinary device (`api.Models.Device.IsGateway`), then forwards other devices' Config/SensorData/Event/Command traffic to `Agrumy.Api`'s `GatewayApiController` instead of reporting its own sensors. Three profiles (`GatewayProfile`): WiFi repeater (transparent HTTP forwarder), LoRaWAN via ChirpStack MQTT, or the private (non-LoRaWAN) protocol over a serial-attached RadioLib radio. Not needed at all when a device relays LoRa uplinks over its own WiFi instead (see "Gateway" below). |
| `Agrumy.Rules` | class library | Pure rule-tree evaluation - fold logic, hierarchy precedence, astronomical/day-night resolvers - with no EF Core or ASP.NET Core dependency, only `Agrumy.Shared` model types; mirrors `AgrumyFirmware`'s `RelayLogic.cpp`/`ActuatorController` as a genuinely separate C# runtime rather than sharing code with it. |
| `Agrumy.Api.Migrations.MySql`, `Agrumy.Api.Migrations.Postgres` | class library | Per-provider EF Core migrations for `AgrumyDbContext` - see "Database & schema provisioning" below for how a schema change gets added to both. |
| `Agrumy.Api.Tests` | test project | Integration tests that run the real EF Core stack against both providers in parallel (`AGRUMY_TEST_MYSQL`/`AGRUMY_TEST_POSTGRES` connection strings, both provisioned as CI service containers in `build.yml`), `WebApplicationFactory`-driven HTTP tests covering auth/rate-limiting/exception-handling through the real middleware pipeline, plus unit tests for the alert/schedule/hysteresis evaluators and the rule-engine fold/hierarchy logic. |
| `tools/Agrumy.ContractGen`, `tools/Agrumy.MqttCredentialSync` | console apps | Small standalone utilities, not part of the running system - ContractGen regenerates `contracts/device-api/*.schema.json` from the `Agrumy.Shared` DTOs (see "Practical advantages" below); MqttCredentialSync provisions/rotates a device's MQTT broker credentials directly against `Agrumy.Dal`, no `Agrumy.Api` host involved. |

`db/migrations/baseline.sql` documents the pre-EF schema for reference only - the schema
is now owned by the `AgrumyDbContext` model and applied via EF Core migrations.

## How it works

1. **Registration.** A device calls `POST /api/Device/Register` with the owning
   user's email, that user's `DevicePin` (a 6-char alphanumeric code the user
   generates from My Profile / `POST /api/User/DevicePin`, valid 24 hours and
   reusable for as many devices as needed in that window), and its MAC
   address. The pin has to match and be unexpired; on success the API creates
   the device row (if it doesn't exist yet) under that user's account and hands
   back an `ApiId`/`ApiKey` pair plus its current config. `POST /api/Discovery/Scan`
   + `POST /api/Discovery/Register` offer a zero-touch alternative: an already
   set-up sensor-only device scans for nearby unconfigured APs, an admin picks
   one from the results and supplies (or reuses a saved) WiFi network, and the
   server queues a `ProvisionDevice` command the scanning device delivers -
   registration then happens automatically, without anyone touching the new
   device directly.
2. **Auth.** The device authenticates with `ApiId`/`ApiKey` via
   `POST /api/Device/Authenticate` (constant-time comparison,
   `DeviceAuthenticationProvider.VerifyDeviceAsync`) and gets back a short-lived
   `apiAuth` token that's cached server-side in memory, not a JWT.
3. **Config sync.** The device polls `POST /api/Device/Config` with its current
   `ConfigVersion`. The API only sends a new config body back if the version
   differs from what's stored; otherwise it replies with an empty 200 so the
   device does nothing. Sensor telemetry goes up the other way via
   `POST /api/SensorData`.
4. **Control is local to the device.** Relay decisions (ventilation, heating,
   water pump, lighting) run in the device firmware (`AgrumyFirmware` repo) against
   whatever config it last saved to its own flash storage. If the config-sync
   request fails - no network, API unreachable - the firmware logs the failure
   and carries on with the previous config instead of halting, so irrigation/
   climate control keeps running on stale-but-known-good settings through an
   outage; it just won't pick up config *changes* until connectivity comes back.
   A Notification-action rule is one exception to "control is local to the
   device" - it has no relay to drive, so it's evaluated server-side instead,
   by `RuleNotificationEvaluator`. An admin-triggered Manual Actuate override
   (a zone or unit's relay forced on for a fixed duration, or until a target
   sensor value is reached) is the other - it rides down on the next config
   poll same as a rule set, expiring on its own once its safety-capped
   duration passes.
5. **Heartbeat and commands.** Every config-poll doubles as a heartbeat -
   `Uptime`/`Rssi`/`FreeHeap`/`FirmwareVersion`/`Board` land in `deviceDiagnostic`
   and drive the Fleet page's online/offline status. The same poll response
   carries any command an operator queued for that device (`POST
   /api/DeviceCommand` - Reboot / ForceOTA / ForceConfigSync), stored in the
   single `deviceOutbox` table that every delivery path (direct poll, gateway
   batch, LoRa relay) reads from; the device acts on it and reports back via
   `POST /api/Device/Command/Ack`. When the server has an MQTT broker configured
   (Server Settings), a newly-queued command also gets an immediate best-effort
   push there (`Agrumy.Api.Commands.MqttCommandPublisher`, signed with the
   device's own `ApiKey`) for a persistently-connected device to act on right
   away - the poll-based delivery above is what still guarantees it arrives
   eventually if that push fails or MQTT isn't configured.

## Automation rule engine

Agrumy's rule engine is deliberately bounded, not general-purpose: each relay
function (ventilation/light/heating/water-pump) - or, for a Notification-action
rule, each rule name - holds a set of rules, any one of which turning "on"
wins (OR across rules). Within one rule, up to 8 Threshold/Interval/Schedule/
Astronomical conditions fold strictly left-to-right by AND/OR ("(A AND B) OR C",
never "A AND (B OR C)" - no parentheses or operator precedence). Rules live at
Simulation, Experiment, Zone (Parcel for an Open-Field farm), Unit (Crop), Farm,
or organization-wide Global scope, in that precedence order (`Agrumy.Rules.
RuleHierarchyResolver`) - the most specific scope defining a rule for a given
function/name wins outright and replaces rather than merges with a less
specific one, except a rule marked `IsSafetyRule`, which survives regardless of
scope and ORs in alongside whichever scope's rules won, so a Zone-level
override can no longer suppress a Global frost-guard. Simulation/Experiment
only ever contribute rules for a device currently inside an active
simulation/experiment, empty otherwise. A Notification-action rule
can also fire on another Notification rule's own result ("another rule fired")
for simple chaining. Threshold's metric/direction is still implicit per relay
function; a Notification rule picks an explicit sensor metric instead, since
there's no relay to imply one - including a few PSEUDO metrics with no device
sensor behind them at all (live outdoor temperature/humidity/wind from the
configured weather provider, for a climate-mirroring alert). Arbitrary nested boolean logic spanning
different metrics/functions in one condition still needs to be added in C#,
not configured through the rule editor.

An admin can also override a rule's decision directly for a zone or a whole
unit - Manual Actuate turns a relay on for a fixed duration, or until a target
sensor value is reached (Heating/Ventilation/WaterPump only, matched to a
sensible metric per function), capped by the same max-run-seconds safety limit
the rule engine itself respects, and expiring on its own without needing a
second call to turn it back off.

Two relay functions (Screen, Vent) are positional rather than plain on/off - a
rule for either carries a `TargetPercent` instead of just turning "on", and
several true rules for the same function MAX-fold their percentages together
instead of a plain OR. Every other relay function still resolves to the same
0/100 shape underneath, so the fold is one engine, not a special case for the
positional functions.

## Quickstart

`appsettings.json` is git-ignored in every project (it holds real secrets). Copy
the template and fill it in:

```
cp Agrumy.Api/appsettings.json.example Agrumy.Api/appsettings.json
cp Agrumy.Web/appsettings.json.example Agrumy.Web/appsettings.json
```

Build the solution:

```
dotnet build agrumy.sln
```

Start the API first, then the web app (the web app calls the API on startup for
login):

```
# terminal 1
dotnet run --project Agrumy.Api     # http://localhost:5000  (Swagger at /swagger)

# terminal 2
dotnet run --project Agrumy.Web     # http://localhost:5001
```

`Agrumy.Web/appsettings.json` -> `WebView:ApiService` must match the port `Agrumy.Api`
listens on (5000 by default, set in `Agrumy.Api/Properties/launchSettings.json`).

One-time per clone, enables the tracked pre-commit hooks (currently just
`tools/check_roadmap_refs.py`, blocking new "Roadmap #NNN" comments before they're
committed rather than after they're pushed):

```
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

CI runs the same script twice as a backstop for anyone who skipped that one-time
step: a fast standalone `roadmap-ref-check.yml` workflow, and again inside
`build.yml` itself so disabling the standalone workflow can't silently drop the
check.

## Configuration

**`Agrumy.Api/appsettings.json`**

| Key | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection` | yes | Connection string for the engine selected by `Database:Provider` |
| `Database:Provider` | no (default `mysql`) | `mysql`/`mariadb` (Pomelo) or `postgres`/`postgresql` (Npgsql). Also overridable via the `AGRUMY_DB_PROVIDER` env var. |
| `JWT:SecureKey` | yes | long random secret (>= 32 chars); app throws on startup without it |
| `JWT:Issuer` | yes | e.g. `https://api.agrumy.com` |
| `JWT:Audience` | yes | e.g. `agrumy-api` |
| `Security:EnforceHttps` | no (default `true`) | `false` = serve plain HTTP, no redirect/HSTS - needed while `AgrumyFirmware` firmware still calls `http://` |
| `Security:KnownProxies` | no (default empty = loopback only) | comma-separated IPs of reverse proxies trusted to set `X-Forwarded-For`/`X-Forwarded-Proto` for the rate limiter. Never point this at an untrusted/public address - that lets a client spoof its own IP and dodge rate limiting. |
| `Startup:FailFastOnDbCheck` | no (default `false`) | `true` = stop the app if the DB check / provisioning fails |
| `ServerConfig:Reload` | no (default `false`) | `true` = overwrite the DB `serverConfig` row's hysteresis fields from `ServerConfig:Hysteresis` below on every startup, discarding admin-UI edits. Seed-once is the normal mode; flip to `true` only to force a reset, then back to `false`. |
| `ServerConfig:Hysteresis:*` | no | dead-zone margins (`WaterLevel`/`Temperature`/`Humidity`/`Light`) new devices are seeded with |
| `ServerConfig:BatteryLowThreshold`, `BatteryLowHysteresis` | no (default `20.0`/`5.0`) | percent. `LowBatteryAlertEvaluator` alerts at/below the threshold, rearms only once the reading climbs back to threshold+hysteresis |
| `ServerConfig:EventDedupeMinutes` | no (default `10`) | a device repeating the same event type within this window is dropped, not stored |
| `ServerConfig:ActivationResendCooldownMinutes` | no (default `10`) | minimum minutes between "resend activation email" requests |
| `ServerConfig:MaxRulesPerZone` | no | soft cap on rules per scope (Zone/Unit/Farm/Global), hard-clamped to 32 regardless of this setting to match `AgrumyFirmware`'s own `MAX_RULES` |
| `ServerConfig:GatewayEnabled`, `GatewayMode`, `GatewayWaitWindowSeconds` | no (default off / `Realtime` / `30`) | enables `POST /api/Gateway/*`. `Realtime` forwards each batched device entry immediately; `Aggregated` holds entries up to the wait-window for a LoRa Class A device's decoupled uplink/downlink cycle |
| `Notifications:Email:*` | no (default off) | SMTP alert email. `Enabled` + `Host` + `FromAddress` are the minimum; `Port`/`UseStartTls`/`Username`/`Password`/`FromName` optional. Disabled or incomplete = channel skipped, not an error. |
| `Notifications:Push:*` | no (default off) | FCM push channel - **prepared but inert**. Stays skipped until the Android app registers device tokens and the OAuth step in `FcmPushNotificationChannel` is wired. Leave `Enabled=false`. |
| `Notifications:Webhook:*` | no (default off) | generic HTTP POST channel for notifying an external system, DB-backed via the Server Settings page rather than these keys once configured there. `Enabled` + `Url` (must be `https://`) are the minimum; optional `Secret` adds an `X-Agrumy-Signature` HMAC-SHA256 header the receiver can verify. `Url` goes through the same `SsrfGuard` as firmware fetches before every send - resolved-address revalidation happens at actual-connect time (`SocketsHttpHandler.ConnectCallback`), not just once against the URL, so a DNS answer can't be swapped for a private address between the check and the request. An admin can relax either the https-only or private-network block per exact hostname/CIDR via `GET/POST/DELETE /api/ServerConfig/WebhookSsrfAllowlist` - Firmware fetches have their own separate `.../FirmwareSsrfAllowlist`, the two lists never share entries. |
| `Notifications:OfflineCheckIntervalMinutes` | no (default `5`) | how often `OfflineAlertBackgroundService` sweeps every device for a newly-offline one and notifies its admins via whatever `Notifications:*` channels are configured above |
| `Notifications:BatteryCheckIntervalMinutes` | no (default `30`) | how often `LowBatteryAlertEvaluator` sweeps every device's latest battery telemetry; longer than the offline interval by default since a battery drains over hours/days, not seconds |
| `Notifications:RuleCheckIntervalMinutes` | no (default `5`) | how often `RuleNotificationEvaluator` sweeps Notification-action rules (the server-side counterpart to the on-device Relay-action rule engine, since firmware has no way to send a notification itself) |
| `Firmware:LocalPath` | no (default `firmware-store`) | directory the **Local** firmware repository stores/serves `.bin` files from (`GET /api/Firmware/Download/{file}`). Relative = under the content root; must be writable by the service user. |
| `Firmware:GitHubRepository` | no (default `dopiskur/AgrumyFirmware`) | `owner/name` whose GitHub Releases feed the catalog - only seeds the `serverConfig` row, the live value is edited on the Server Settings page |
| `Firmware:GitHubToken` | no | optional GitHub API token; public repositories need none |
| `WebView:Enabled`, `WebView:ApiService` | no | present in `appsettings.json.example` as a documented switch for a possible combined API+UI deployment, but **not currently read by any code** - `Agrumy.Web` is what actually serves the admin UI today |

**`Agrumy.Web/appsettings.json`**

| Key | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WebView:ApiService` | yes | base URL of `Agrumy.Api` (default `http://localhost:5000`) |
| `JWT:SecureKey`, `JWT:Issuer`, `JWT:Audience` | yes | **must be identical** to `Agrumy.Api`'s values, otherwise cookie tokens fail validation and every page redirects to login |
| `DataProtection:KeyPath` | no (default: a `dataprotection-keys` dir next to, not inside, the app folder) | where cookie-auth/antiforgery encryption keys persist. Must sit outside anything a redeploy wipes (not `bin/`), and be read/write for the account the service actually runs as. |

## Database & schema provisioning

The data-access layer is EF Core (`Agrumy.Dal/AgrumyDbContext` + the per-facet
`Dal/EfXxxRepository` classes), LINQ only - no stored procedures. It runs on
**MySQL/MariaDB** (Pomelo) or **PostgreSQL** (Npgsql), chosen by
`Database:Provider` (see Configuration).

On startup `SchemaBootstrapper.EnsureSchemaAsync` runs real EF Core migrations
(`db.Database.MigrateAsync()`) - an empty database gets every migration from
scratch, an up-to-date one is a no-op. A database built by the old pre-migrations
`EnsureCreatedAsync()` path (detected by a `device` table existing with no
`__EFMigrationsHistory`, e.g. invent.hr) is handled first by
`MarkLegacyEnsureCreatedSchemaAsBaselineAsync`: it marks every migration up to
that point as already-applied directly in `__EFMigrationsHistory`, so the
following `MigrateAsync()` sees nothing left to do instead of failing on
`CREATE TABLE` against tables that already exist. Whether a *failed* check
stops the app or just logs a warning is controlled by `Startup:FailFastOnDbCheck`
(see Configuration above).

`EnsureSchemaAsync` also seeds rows, never just tables: the four `deviceType*`
lookup tables get the product's fixed catalog (device types, service types,
relay types, sensor types) if empty, and a completely empty `user` table gets
exactly one bootstrap **Global Admin** account (`PwdHash`/`PwdSalt` left `NULL`
on purpose). A `NULL`
password hash means nothing can log in as that account yet -
`POST /api/User/BootstrapSetPassword` is the one-shot call that gives it a real
password (Agrumy.Web shows a "set password" screen instead of the login form while
`GET /api/User/BootstrapPending` is true). None of this runs against a database
that already has any users - existing installs, including api.agrumy.com, are
unaffected.

### Schema evolution

Real EF Core migrations, one project per provider (`Agrumy.Api.Migrations.MySql`,
`Agrumy.Api.Migrations.Postgres` - both reference `Agrumy.Dal` for the shared
`AgrumyDbContext` model, `Agrumy.Api.Dal.AgrumyDbContextDesignTimeFactory` lets
`dotnet ef` build a context without booting the web host). After changing an
entity, add the matching migration to both:

```
dotnet ef migrations add <Name> --project Agrumy.Api.Migrations.MySql    --startup-project Agrumy.Api -- --provider mysql
dotnet ef migrations add <Name> --project Agrumy.Api.Migrations.Postgres --startup-project Agrumy.Api -- --provider postgres
```

`SchemaBootstrapper.EnsureSchemaAsync` applies whatever is pending on the next
startup - no manual `dotnet ef database update` needed against a running
environment. Forgetting to add a migration for a model change doesn't wait to
surface until deployment: CI's `RelationalIntegrationTests` migrates an empty
database of each provider and then asserts both `GetPendingMigrations()` is
empty and `Database.HasPendingModelChanges()` is false, so a drifted model fails
the build. `db/migrations/baseline.sql` documents the pre-migrations schema for
reference only, not something a new migration is written against.

### Provider notes

- **EF Core is held at 9.0.x** (`Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore*`, Pomelo 9.0.0,
  Npgsql 9.0.4). The runtime still targets net10.0; the pin is only because the
  official Pomelo MySQL provider has no EF Core 10 build yet.
- **Legacy foreign keys.** The model configures primary keys, the unique indexes
  the app depends on (`email_UNIQUE`, `Username_UNIQUE`, `ApiID_UNIQUE`,
  `Name_UNIQUE`) and the legacy `NO ACTION` FKs; navigation properties are not
  mapped - each `EfXxxRepository` joins explicitly in LINQ. A legacy database
  keeps whatever FKs it already had unless a later migration explicitly changes
  them (see "Schema evolution" above for how a legacy DB is brought under
  migrations without a `CREATE TABLE` clash).
- **PostgreSQL:** `NpgsqlCompat` opts into pre-6.0 timestamp behaviour
  (`DateTime` -> `timestamp without time zone`, any `DateTimeKind`) because the
  schema stores naive local datetimes throughout. Legacy MySQL `0000-00-00`
  values must be cleaned before such data can be loaded into PostgreSQL; for
  MySQL itself, add `AllowZeroDateTime=True;ConvertZeroDateTime=True` to the
  connection string if the data contains any.
- **TimescaleDB (tiered-hybrid deployment).** The provider choice
  *is* the deployment-size choice: MariaDB/MySQL is the small-deployment tier
  and stays an ordinary table, no code path runs for it. Choosing PostgreSQL
  is choosing the large-deployment tier - on every startup,
  `SchemaBootstrapper.EnsureTimescaleHypertableAsync` runs `CREATE EXTENSION IF
  NOT EXISTS timescaledb` and converts the sensor-reading table (`dataSensor` -
  renamed from `sensorData`, same rename applied to `controllerData` ->
  `dataController`) into a hypertable partitioned on `DateCreated` (widening its
  PK to `(IDSensorData, DateCreated)`, which TimescaleDB requires). This needs no
  application code branching - EF Core LINQ queries against `dataSensor` run
  unchanged on both providers, Timescale just partitions/prunes transparently
  underneath. A self-hosted Postgres without the extension installed isn't a
  startup failure: the `CREATE EXTENSION` call is caught, a warning is logged,
  and `dataSensor` is left as a plain table, same as the MariaDB tier. Verified
  against `timescale/timescaledb:latest-pg17` - a bare `postgres:17` container
  (as used by the dev/test fixture above) exercises the same warn-and-skip path.

## API endpoints

**Versioning:** every route below is implicitly API version `1.0`
(`ApiControllerBase` carries `[ApiVersion("1.0")]`, inherited by every controller) served at the
same unversioned URL it always has - `AssumeDefaultVersionWhenUnspecified` means device firmware
and `Agrumy.Web`'s Refit client keep working with zero version info in the request. A future
breaking change should land as a new `[ApiVersion("2.0")]` controller under its own `api/v2/...`
route rather than altering an existing v1 action, so old and new clients both keep working. An
explicit version can be sent via `?api-version=1.0`, an `X-Api-Version` header, or a `v{version}`
URL segment; an unsupported version gets `400` with an `api-supported-versions` response header.

All routes below are under `Agrumy.Api`. `[Authorize]` requires a JWT bearer
token from `POST /api/User/Login`. Most write/admin endpoints require one of
the **composable roles** in `api.Security.RoleNames` rather than a single
`admin` flag - each of `UserManagers`/`DeviceManagers`/`Admins` matches a Global
tier (crosses every account on the server) and an account-scoped tier, each
split further into Admin/User/Device sub-roles; a handful of server-wide
actions (below) require the literal `admin` role, i.e. Global admin only,
because they cross every account at once. Device endpoints use the separate
apiId/apiKey/apiAuth scheme described in "How it works", not JWT.

**User** (`UserApiController`, `api/User`)

| Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/User/Register` | rate-limited, no auth | Self-service registration; account is inactive until `Activate` |
| `GET /api/User/Activate` | rate-limited, no auth | Confirms the emailed activation token |
| `POST /api/User/ResendActivation` | rate-limited, no auth | Re-sends the activation email |
| `POST /api/User/Login` | rate-limited, no auth | Returns a JWT access token + refresh token |
| `POST /api/User/RefreshToken` | rate-limited, no auth | Silent renewal - rotates the refresh token, detects reuse of an already-rotated one |
| `POST /api/User/RevokeRefreshToken` | rate-limited, no auth | Logout - invalidates one refresh token |
| `GET /api/User/BootstrapPending` | no auth | True while the fresh-install bootstrap Global Admin still has no password |
| `POST /api/User/BootstrapSetPassword` | rate-limited, no auth | One-shot - sets the bootstrap Global Admin's password, then this always returns 403 |
| `POST /api/User/ChangePassword` | rate-limited, JWT (self) | Change the caller's own password (old password required) |
| `PUT /api/User/Profile` | JWT (self) | Update the caller's own display name / IANA time zone |
| `POST /api/User/DevicePin` | JWT (self) | Issue/reuse the caller's still-valid 6-char device-registration PIN (24h expiry, multi-use within that window) |
| `GET /api/User/All`, `GET /api/User/Self`, `GET /api/User` | JWT | List users / fetch own record / fetch a user by id |
| `POST /api/User`, `PUT /api/User` | UserManagers | Create / update a user |
| `DELETE /api/User` | UserManagers | Delete a user (ids 0 and 1 are protected) |
| `GET /api/User/Roles`, `GET /api/User/UserRoles` | UserManagers | List available roles / a user's assigned roles |
| `PUT /api/User/UserRoles` | Admins | Set a user's roles |
| `GET /api/User/Group/All`, `GET /api/User/Group` | UserManagers | List / fetch an account's user groups |
| `POST /api/User/Group`, `DELETE /api/User/Group` | Admins | Create / delete a user group |

**Device** (`DeviceApiController`, `api/Device`)

| Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/Device/Register` | device pin | Device self-registration (see "How it works") |
| `POST /api/Device/Authenticate` | apiId/apiKey | Issues the short-lived `apiAuth` token |
| `POST /api/Device/Config` | apiId/apiAuth | Config-version-checked config sync; also carries any queued `DeviceCommand` and diagnostic heartbeat fields |
| `POST /api/Device/Event`, `POST /api/Device/Command/Ack` | apiId/apiAuth | Device pushes an event / acknowledges a command |
| `GET /api/Device/All`, `GET /api/Device` | JWT | List devices / fetch one |
| `GET /api/Device/Fleet` | JWT | Every device's latest diagnostic + online/offline status |
| `GET /api/Device/Events` | JWT | A device's event log |
| `PUT /api/Device`, `DELETE /api/Device` | DeviceManagers | Update / delete a device |
| `GET/PUT /api/Device/Sensor`, `GET/PUT /api/Device/Controller` | JWT (PUT DeviceManagers) | Read/update a device's sensor or controller config |
| `POST /api/Device/FirmwareUpdate`, `DELETE /api/Device/FirmwareUpdate` | DeviceManagers | Queue / cancel an OTA update for one device |
| `GET /api/Device/Type`, `TypeService`, `TypeRelay`, `TypeSensor` | JWT | Fixed lookup lists used to build device config forms |

**DeviceCommand** (`DeviceCommandApiController`)

| Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/DeviceCommand` | DeviceManagers | Queue Reboot / ForceOTA / ForceConfigSync for one or more devices into `deviceOutbox`; delivered on the device's next config poll, plus a best-effort instant MQTT push if the server has a broker configured |

**DeviceFarmUnit** (`DeviceFarmUnitApiController`, `api/DeviceFarmUnit`) - the Farm > Unit > Zone fleet hierarchy
for a Greenhouse farm (`DeviceFarm.FarmType`); an Open-Field farm uses the parallel Crop/Parcel branch instead
(mirrors Unit/Zone exactly in shape and behavior), see **FarmOpenfield** below for what's specific to it. Farm
CRUD/reorder/delete/recycle-bin here is shared by both branches.

| Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/DeviceFarmUnit/Farm/All`, `GET .../Farm` | JWT | List farms / fetch one |
| `POST/PUT/DELETE /api/DeviceFarmUnit/Farm` | DeviceManagers | Create / update / delete a farm - the top tier above Unit |
| `GET /api/DeviceFarmUnit/All`, `GET /api/DeviceFarmUnit` | JWT | List units / fetch one |
| `POST /api/DeviceFarmUnit`, `PUT /api/DeviceFarmUnit`, `DELETE /api/DeviceFarmUnit` | DeviceManagers | Create / update / delete a unit |

| `GET .../Zone/Rule`, `GET .../Unit/Rule`, `GET .../Farm/Rule`, `GET .../Global/Rule`, `GET .../Crop/Rule`, `GET .../Parcel/Rule` | JWT | A zone/unit/farm/account's (or crop's/parcel's, for an Open-Field farm) automation rules - see "Automation rule engine" above for the full scope precedence |
| `POST/DELETE` on the same six routes | DeviceManagers | Add / remove one rule - up to 8 conditions each, see "Automation rule engine"; delete returns 409 if another rule's RuleTriggered condition still references it |
| `POST /api/DeviceFarmUnit/Zone/ManualActuate`, `POST .../Zone/ManualActuate/Stop`, `POST .../Unit/ManualActuate`, `GET .../Zone/ManualActuate` | JWT (POST DeviceManagers) | Start / stop / check a Manual Actuate override for a zone or unit - see "Automation rule engine" |
| `POST /api/DeviceFarmUnit/Zone/ApplyHorticultureCatalog` | DeviceManagers | Turn a chosen Horticulture Catalog entry into a starter set of threshold rules for a zone, skipping any that don't fit under its rule-count cap |
| `POST /api/DeviceFarmUnit/Zone/ApplyDayNightPreset` | DeviceManagers | Add one day-threshold + one night-threshold rule pair for a plain on/off function (not Screen/Vent) |
| `GET /api/DeviceFarmUnit/Dashboard`, `Dashboard/Zones`, `Dashboard/Zone` | JWT | Hierarchical dashboard rollups (per-unit, per-zone-list, per-zone) |

**FarmOpenfield** (`FarmOpenfieldApiController`, `api/FarmOpenfield`) - the Crop/Parcel branch for an Open-Field
farm, parallel to DeviceFarmUnit's Unit/Zone above; Farm-level CRUD and rules stay on DeviceFarmUnitApiController

| Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/FarmOpenfield`, `GET .../All` | DeviceManagers / JWT | Create a Farm together with its Open-Field extension row / list Open-Field farms |
| `GET /api/FarmOpenfield/Crop/All`, `GET .../Crop`, `GET .../Crop/Dashboard` | JWT | List a farm's crops / fetch one / crop dashboard cubes (same sensor-average/status styling as the Unit dashboard) |
| `POST/PUT/DELETE /api/FarmOpenfield/Crop`, `POST .../Crop/Reorder` | DeviceManagers | Create / update / delete / reorder a crop |
| `GET /api/FarmOpenfield/Parcel`, `GET .../ParcelById`, `GET .../Crop/Parcel/Dashboard` | JWT | Parcels under a crop / one by id / parcel dashboard cubes |
| `POST/PUT/DELETE /api/FarmOpenfield/Parcel` | DeviceManagers | Create / update / delete a parcel - same safety-limit validation as a Zone |
| `PUT /api/FarmOpenfield/Parcel/{id}/Migrate` | DeviceManagers | Move a parcel to a different crop within the same account |
| `POST /api/FarmOpenfield/Assign`, `POST .../Unassign` | DeviceManagers | Place / remove a device from a parcel (one controller per parcel, same rule as a Zone) |
| `GET /api/FarmOpenfield/Parcel/{id}/Satellite/Scenes`, `.../Series`, `.../MoistureSeries` | JWT | A zone's available satellite scenes / an index's value over time (NDVI/NDMI/NDWI/NDSI/SWIR-composite/natural-color) / the matching soil-moisture sensor series for the same dates, for the Zone-tab dual-axis chart |
| `GET /api/FarmOpenfield/Parcel/{id}/Satellite/Scenes/{sceneId}/Index/{index}` | JWT | Rendered PNG (scalar indices as a UINT8-quantized grid, natural/SWIR as true color) for one scene |
| `GET /api/FarmOpenfield/{scope}/{id}/Satellite`, `GET .../Satellite/Dates` | JWT | Map overlay + available dates at Farm/Sowing/Parcel/Zone scope - a zone with no scene yet at/before the requested date still draws, empty, rather than disappearing |
| `POST /api/FarmOpenfield/{scope}/{id}/Satellite/SyncNow` | DeviceManagers | Force an immediate scene sync for that scope instead of waiting for the daily background job |

Satellite imagery (Sentinel-2 via the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem, `ISatelliteImagerySource`/`ISatelliteImagerySourceFactory`) is opt-in per account (own CDSE client credentials, tested and saved together with a 24h health indicator) - an account with the module off or unconfigured simply has no scenes and every satellite endpoint above returns empty/no-data rather than an error.

**HorticultureCatalog** (`HorticultureCatalogApiController`, `api/HorticultureCatalog`) - shared read-only agronomy reference data, every account browses the same catalog

| Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/HorticultureCatalog`, `GET .../ById` | JWT | List a subcatalog (Crop/Fruit/Hydroponic/Perma) / fetch one entry, including its per-BBCH-growth-stage ranges for a Crop entry |
| `POST/PUT/DELETE /api/HorticultureCatalog` | Global admin | Create / update / delete a catalog entry |

**Arkod** (`ArkodApiController`, `api/Arkod`) - offline/manual-upload path for a local mirror of Croatia's public ARKOD land-parcel registry; the map's own parcel-geometry click-lookup talks to the government WMS service directly from the browser and never touches this controller

| Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/Arkod/Lookup` | JWT | Look up a parcel's registry geometry by its JPAID from the local GeoPackage mirror (503 if none has been synced/uploaded yet) |
| `POST /api/Arkod/GeoPackage/Upload` | Global admin | Manually upload a `.gpkg` mirror (offline-deployment fallback, up to ~1.2 GB) |
| `POST /api/Arkod/GeoPackage/SyncNow` | Global admin | Run the daily sync job's HEAD-then-conditional-GET check immediately instead of waiting for its next tick |

**Gateway** (`GatewayApiController`, `api/Gateway`) - lets one WiFi-connected device relay other devices' traffic instead of reporting its own sensors, so a fleet of LoRa-only nodes (or a WiFi repeater setup) needs no direct internet reach of their own

| Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/Gateway/Batch` | apiId/apiKey (gateway device) | Runs a batch of other devices' Config/SensorData/Event/CommandAck requests through the same logic each single-device endpoint uses; one bad entry never fails the rest |
| `POST /api/Gateway/RelayUplink` | apiId/apiKey (gateway device) | The WiFi-relay counterpart to Batch for one already RF-decoded LoRa private-protocol frame, resolved against the gateway's own device mappings. Accepts both wire versions: v1's plain monotonic counter is checked against the last-seen value, v2 (a boot nonce is present) instead replays against a per-device `deviceLoRaSession` row - device firmware age decides which one a given node sends |
| `GET /api/Gateway/DeviceMapping` | apiId/apiKey (gateway device) | The calling gateway's own address->device forwarding table, including secrets it needs to reconstruct each device's request |
| `GET /api/Gateway/All` | DeviceManagers | List every device registered as a gateway |
| `GET /api/Gateway/DeviceMapping/All`, `POST/DELETE /api/Gateway/DeviceMapping` | DeviceManagers | Admin CRUD for one gateway's node-address-to-device mappings |

**Discovery** (`DiscoveryApiController`, `api/Discovery`) - zero-touch provisioning: a scanning device finds nearby unconfigured devices, an admin registers them without touching them directly

| Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/Discovery/Report` | apiId/apiAuth (device) | A scanning device reports one nearby unconfigured access point it found |
| `POST /api/Discovery/Scan` | DeviceManagers | Fan out a "scan for devices" command to every sensor-only device in a zone/unit/whole fleet |
| `GET /api/Discovery/Results` | JWT | Aggregated scan results (optionally scoped to a unit/zone) |
| `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/Discovery/WifiConfigs` | JWT / DeviceManagers | Saved WiFi networks the Register step can offer instead of asking for credentials each time (passwords only returned to a caller who manages devices) |
| `POST /api/Discovery/Register` | DeviceManagers | Resolves WiFi credentials + a fresh device PIN and queues a provisioning command at the winning scanning device |

**Simulation** (`SimulationApiController`, `api/Simulation`) - fully virtual devices for testing without real hardware

| Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/Simulation/Device` | Simulation managers | Registers a virtual device through the same `POST /api/Device/Register` flow a real device uses, then tags it so `VirtualDeviceRunnerBackgroundService` starts driving it (fake sensor readings via `SimulatedSensorGenerator`, self-HTTP config polls via `VirtualDeviceClient`) |
| `GET /api/Simulation/Device` | Simulation managers | List the caller's virtual device ids |
| `DELETE /api/Simulation/Device/{idDevice}` | Simulation managers | Stop and remove a virtual device |

**ControllerData** (`ControllerDataApiController`, `api/ControllerData`) - real-time relay state, parallel to SensorData but fired on every actual relay change rather than a fixed interval

| Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/ControllerData` | apiId/apiAuth (device) | Device pushes its relay on/off state changes |
| `GET /api/ControllerData` | JWT | A device's relay-state history |

**AuditLog** (`AuditLogApiController`, `api/AuditLog`)

| Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/AuditLog` | Admins | Read-only admin-action trail (who did what, to what, when) - a Global admin sees everything, an account-scoped admin only their own account's history |

**Firmware** (`FirmwareApiController`, `api/Firmware`)

| Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/Firmware` | DeviceManagers | List catalog entries, optionally filtered by board |
| `POST /api/Firmware/Sync` | Global admin | Refresh the catalog from the configured source (GitHub / Custom repository) |
| `POST /api/Firmware/Import` | Global admin | Pull one release's files into the **Local** repository |
| `POST /api/Firmware/Upload`, `POST /api/Firmware/UploadZip` | Global admin | Manually add a `.bin`, or extract+import a ZIP, into the Local repository |
| `DELETE /api/Firmware` | Global admin | Remove a catalog entry |
| `GET /api/Firmware/Manifest` | DeviceManagers | This install's catalog as manifest.json, for another install's Custom repository |
| `GET /api/Firmware/Fetch` | DeviceManagers | Streams one catalog file through the API (Flash Device tab) |
| `GET /api/Firmware/DownloadZip` | DeviceManagers | Visible catalog + manifest.json packaged as a ZIP |
| `GET /api/Firmware/Download/{fileName}` | no auth | Serves a `.bin` from the Local store (device OTA download) |

**`Download` is anonymous by design** - a device's OTA fetch is a bare HTTP GET
with no auth headers, the same as a public GitHub release asset. This is only safe because
`fileName` is unpredictable in the sense that matters: it must match `FirmwareVersion`'s
release convention (`agrumy-{board}-v{semver}.bin`), i.e. a caller must already know a real
board name and an actually-released semver - not a guessable sequential id - and that
information is itself public (the catalog and GitHub Releases already list it to anyone with
API access). Rate-limited via the `device-data` policy (60 req/min/IP) against bulk-download
abuse. If this ever needs to be tightened further, short-lived signed URLs are the natural
next step - not required today.

**ServerConfig** (`ServerConfigApiController`, `api/ServerConfig`)

| Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/ServerConfig` | admin | The whole server-wide settings row (secrets redacted) - Global admin/reader only, applies across every account |
| `GET`/`PUT /api/ServerConfig/{DeviceDefaults,Accounts,Alerts,Firmware,DataRetention,Weather,Gateway,Mqtt,Email,Webhook,OData,Arkod}` | admin | One domain section each; a PUT rewrites only that section's fields, so no save can blank a field its form never rendered. `POST /api/ServerConfig/ArchiveSettings` is the archiving section's own test-then-save |
| `GET /api/ServerConfig/Public` | no auth | The subset of server config safe to expose pre-login (e.g. registration open/closed) |
| `GET /api/ServerConfig/Health` | admin | Per-dependency Server Health card (MQTT/Email/Firmware source/Weather/Gateway/background workers) - only lists a dependency currently enabled/configured, polled by the Web page on an interval rather than an on-demand test button |

**DataMaintenance** (`DataMaintenanceApiController`, `api/DataMaintenance`)

| Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/DataMaintenance/Provider` | admin | Whether the DB is MySQL/MariaDB (affects whether "shrink files on disk" is offered) |
| `POST /api/DataMaintenance/Optimize`, `POST /api/DataMaintenance/Purge` | admin | Queue an old-data optimize/purge job on `BackgroundJobQueue`; returns 202 immediately, runs async |

**SensorData** (`SensorDataApiController`, `api/SensorData`)

| Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/SensorData` | JWT | Sensor readings for a device over a time range |
| `POST /api/SensorData` | rate-limited | Device telemetry push (includes `Battery`) |
| `DELETE /api/SensorData` | JWT admin | Bulk-delete sensor data for a device/time range |

**Observability** (`Agrumy.Api/Diagnostics`, `Agrumy.Api/Startup/ObservabilityServiceExtensions.cs`)

| Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/health` | no auth | Liveness probe (DB + cache-backend checks) for a load balancer or an auto-update rollback step; reports the deployed build's version and commit |
| `GET /api/metrics` | Metrics readers (Global admin/reader, or an account's own data-reader role) | Per-route+method request count/error count/avg/min/max duration, from an in-memory aggregate |
| `GET /api/metrics/prometheus` | Metrics readers | The same counters exposed as a Prometheus scrape endpoint (OpenTelemetry exporter on the same `Agrumy.Api` meter) |

## Practical advantages

Beyond the architecture points above, a handful of smaller, concrete
things that make Agrumy easier to trust and run day-to-day:

- **Offline-resilient by design.** Relay control runs entirely on-device against
  its last-saved config (see "Control is local to the device" above) - a lost
  connection to the API doesn't stop irrigation/climate control, it just delays
  picking up config changes.
- **A Farm > Unit > Zone hierarchy with a live dashboard**, or Farm > Crop >
  Parcel for an Open-Field farm (`api/FarmOpenfield`) - the same dashboard
  rollup and rule scoping either way. `GET /api/DeviceFarmUnit/Dashboard` rolls
  up status across an entire fleet of installations, not just one controller.
- **Fleet-wide commands with server-side fan-out.** `POST /api/DeviceCommand`
  targets a unit or zone and the server resolves that into the actual set of
  devices to deliver Reboot/ForceOTA/ForceConfigSync to on their next poll.
- **Zero-touch device provisioning.** `POST /api/Discovery/Scan` +
  `POST /api/Discovery/Register` let an already-configured sensor-only device
  find and register a brand-new one over WiFi, no direct access to the new
  device needed.
- **LoRa reach without extra bridge hardware.** A device can relay other
  LoRa-only nodes' uplinks over its own WiFi connection (`POST
  /api/Gateway/RelayUplink`), or a dedicated `Agrumy.Gateway` process can do
  the same over LoRaWAN/ChirpStack or a private radio protocol.
- **Simulation Mode.** Fully virtual devices, driven by a real background
  worker calling the real registration/config/sensor endpoints, let a whole
  fleet be tested and demoed without any physical hardware; a per-device
  Latitude/Longitude override lets a demo device appear anywhere on the map
  without touching its real GPS/manual location, reverting automatically the
  moment the simulation is disabled.
- **25 native firmware unit tests in CI**, no hardware required
  (`AgrumyFirmware/test/test_native_*`) - relay/hysteresis/schedule/safety-limit/
  AND-OR-fold/discovery/LoRa/manual-override/PID/output-kind-dispatch logic is
  regression-tested on every push, not just checked by hand on a bench; the
  threshold-evaluation suite runs against a `threshold_vectors.csv` shared
  verbatim between this repo and `AgrumyFirmware`, so both sides agree on the
  same inputs/outputs.
- **Contract-first device↔API.** Every device request/response shape is a JSON
  Schema in `contracts/device-api/`, checked against both the firmware and the
  API's actual field usage (`AgrumyFirmware/tools/contract-check`) - firmware and
  server can't silently drift apart on wire format.
- **Account export/import and a one-click Emergency Stop.** An account admin can
  export their whole farm hierarchy (users, devices, rules, optionally sensor
  history) as a portable ZIP and bring it back in under a different name -
  useful for migrating between servers or standing up a demo from real data,
  without server-side access. Emergency Stop forces every actuator in an
  account off ahead of any rule, pushed immediately rather than waiting for the
  next config poll, and stays off until explicitly cleared - deliberately a
  single click with no confirmation step, since hesitation is the wrong default
  for a safety control.
- **OTA plus fully offline firmware distribution.** The same firmware catalog
  that drives normal OTA updates also supports offline USB installs and
  Local/Custom repository sources - useful anywhere internet access to GitHub
  isn't guaranteed.
- **One-line self-hosted install** (see below) - no config file to hand-write,
  no database to prepare first, safe to re-run.
- **On-device safety limits, not just server-side policy.** `ActuatorController`
  enforces cooldown/max-run ordering for every relay function directly on the
  device, so a bad or delayed config can't leave a pump or heater running
  unbounded even during an outage.
- **A predictable, bounded rule model, not a hidden DSL.** See "Automation rule
  engine" above - fold-based AND/OR conditions and a Zone/Unit/Farm/Global rule
  hierarchy cover most real automation needs without becoming a general rule
  engine to learn.
- **Battery-powered devices as a first-class case**, not an afterthought -
  battery telemetry, low-battery alerting and deep sleep for sensor-only nodes
  are built in, not bolted on.
- **A tiered storage strategy that scales down as well as up.** Plain MySQL/
  MariaDB for a small deployment, TimescaleDB hypertables for a large one -
  the same schema and queries either way, chosen by one config value.
- **A clear vertical focus.** Agrumy isn't trying to be a general home-automation
  hub - every model and rule is shaped around greenhouse/citrus micro-climate
  and irrigation specifically, not a generic "IoT platform."
- **Crop-specific configuration templates.** A Horticulture Catalog (Crop/Fruit/
  Hydroponic/Perma entries, each a recommended AirTemp/SoilTemp/Humidity/
  Moisture/Light range, and Crop entries additionally broken down by BBCH
  growth stage) lets a new zone start from agronomy know-how already built
  into the product - `POST .../Zone/ApplyHorticultureCatalog` turns a chosen
  catalog entry straight into a starter set of threshold rules, skipping any
  that don't fit under the zone's rule-count cap rather than failing outright.
  A separate `POST .../Zone/ApplyDayNightPreset` covers the simpler case of one
  day threshold + one night threshold for a plain on/off function.

## Self-hosted install

For anyone standing up their own instance (not the maintainer's own alpha
deployment - see "Deployment" below for that), one command handles
prerequisites, secrets and startup - no config file to hand-write, no database
to prepare first:

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dopiskur/AgrumyService/master/install.sh | bash
```

Hitting Enter at every prompt is a complete install: `1` (Quick install) ->
`1.1` (Simple/Small) -> `c` (Container). `install.sh` only asks two things:

1. **Quick or Custom.** Quick just picks Simple/Small (MariaDB, no Redis) or
   Large/Scaled (PostgreSQL+TimescaleDB, Redis) - the two deployment tiers.
   Custom asks each option individually (DB provider, TimescaleDB,
   Redis) for combinations neither preset covers.
2. **Container or bare-metal.**
   - **Container** (Docker or Podman - installed automatically if neither is
     found) builds and runs `docker-compose.yml` (Small) or
     `docker-compose.large.yml` (Large/Scaled), generating a `.env` with the DB
     password and JWT secret on first run. `appsettings.json` is never
     touched here - config arrives as environment variables, already fully
     populated before either container starts.
   - **Bare-metal/standalone** downloads the latest tagged release (see
     `.github/workflows/release.yml`) as self-contained `linux-x64` binaries -
     no .NET runtime needed on the target - and installs them as systemd
     services behind nginx or Apache with a certbot TLS cert, picking between
     a hostname split (`api.` / `admin.` subdomains) or a path-based layout
     (one domain or IP, `/api` routed to `Agrumy.Api` and everything else to
     `Agrumy.Web`) for the reverse-proxy config it generates. This path never
     asks about the database up front - `Agrumy.Api` boots into a minimal
     setup wizard the first time `appsettings.json` has no
     `ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection` (`Agrumy.Api/Setup/SetupWizard.cs`);
     saving a connection there restarts the service, and the existing
     bootstrap Global Admin wizard takes over from there unchanged.

**Need more than one node's worth of capacity?** `deploy/k8s/` has a full Kubernetes manifest set -
multi-replica Deployments for `Agrumy.Api`/`Agrumy.Web`, a ConfigMap/Secret pair instead of
`appsettings.json`, an optional autoscaler, and an Ingress with TLS termination. Most installs don't
need this - see that directory's own README for when it's actually worth reaching for.

**Bare-metal first boot: keep the port firewalled off until setup completes** -
the setup wizard is protected against CSRF, not against network access, so
whoever reaches it first can submit the database connection. `install.sh`
doesn't open the firewall for you; leave it closed (or restricted to your own
IP) until the wizard and bootstrap Global Admin step are both done.

Safe to re-run - every step checks whether it's already done before acting, so
re-running later (e.g. to turn on Redis) doesn't repeat completed steps or
overwrite existing secrets.

### Backup / restore (bare-metal installs)

`install.sh --backup <file.tar.gz>` bundles the database, the DataProtection
key ring and the firmware store into one archive, all read at the same
moment - a DB dump alone is not a real backup, since a key ring newer or
older than the data it encrypted just fails differently later:

```
sudo ./install.sh --backup /var/backups/agrumy-$(date +%F).tar.gz
```

Restore with the matching flag against an already-installed instance (run the
normal installer against a fresh database first if starting over, then
restore over it):

```
sudo ./install.sh --restore /var/backups/agrumy-2026-09-11.tar.gz
```

Both flags read the connection string straight out of the installed
`appsettings.json` and detect MySQL vs. PostgreSQL from its shape, so no
separate DB flags are needed. Every real device gets exactly one `401` on its
next poll after a restore (its cached session token predates the restore
point) and silently re-authenticates - expected, not a fault. A device
registered after the backup's timestamp isn't in the restored database at all
and needs re-provisioning from scratch.

**Container installs** back up the named Docker/Podman volumes directly
(`docker compose config --volumes`, then the usual volume-backup tooling) -
`install.sh --backup`/`--restore` only knows the bare-metal filesystem
layout. **Kubernetes** (`deploy/k8s/`) has no built-in backup command either;
back up the DB the same way as any other Postgres/MySQL StatefulSet, and
include the `api-keys` PVC (the DataProtection key ring) in that same backup
policy - it's exactly as load-bearing as the DB dump and easy to overlook
since it's a separate PVC.

## Deployment

CI (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) builds and tests on every push to `master`;
there is no automated deployment. The old Azure Web App workflow
(`master_agrumy.yml`) was removed after its credentials went stale and every
run failed at the Azure login step - restore it from git history if Azure
deployment ever comes back.

The test/alpha environment is deployed manually: self-contained `linux-x64`
`dotnet publish` of `Agrumy.Api` and `Agrumy.Web`, copied to the server over
SSH, run as systemd services behind a reverse proxy. The per-machine
`appsettings.json` (connection string, JWT keys, `Urls`) is git-ignored and
lives only on the server.
